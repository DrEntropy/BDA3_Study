# BDA3_Study
A place for me to save notes and exercises for the book Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd Edition) (started Feb 2025)

I will be following the Course notes [here](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/)

## Note on the code

* Some of this was in python, some in brms, depending on what I was doing. 

* I am experimenting with using .py files using visual studio codes built in support for converting to and fron 
  jupyter notebooks. I will *not* be checking notebooks in, only the python files that can be converted to notebooks. In these files markdown cells are indicated by `# %% [markdown]` and code cells by `# %%`.

* NOTE as of May 26, I am calling the experiment above a failure and going back to using notebooks and committing them.  

* Ended on July 18 2025.
