# BDA3_Study
A place for me to save notes and exercises for the book Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd Edition)

I will be following the Course notes [here](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/)

## Note on the code

* My intention is to do this in python with PYMC. 

* I am experimenting with using .py files using visual studio codes built in support for converting to and fron 
  jupyter notebooks. I will *not* be checking notebooks in, only the python files that can be converted to notebooks. In these files markdown cells are indicated by `# %% [markdown]` and code cells by `# %%`.
